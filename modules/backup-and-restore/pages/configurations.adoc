= Backup and Restore Configurations

This page describes the configuration options available for backup and restore on TigerGraph and how to set them.

== Prerequisites
* You have access to the TigerGraph Linux user account on your cluster.
All commands must be run from the TigerGraph Linux user.

== Configuration parameters

The following is a list of configurations available for backup and restore.

|===
|Configuration parameter |Description |Default

|System.Backup.Local.Enable |Whether to store the database backup data to a local path.
If this parameter is set to true, `System.Backup.S3.Enable` cannot be set to true.
|`false`

|System.Backup.Local.Path |Local path to store the backup files.
Required if backup is to be stored locally. | `null`

|System.Backup.S3.AWSAccessKeyID |The AWS access key ID used for the S3 backup bucket. It corresponds to the "Access Key" in GCS and the "Account Name" in Azure Blob, respectively. | `null`

|System.Backup.S3.AWSSecretAccessKey |The secret access key used for the AWS S3 bucket. It corresponds to the "Secret" in GCS and the "Account Key" in Azure Blob, respectively.

*NOTE*: If setting this in interactive mode, store the key in a file and provide the path to the file, e.g., `@/tmp/test_secret`.
|`+null+`

|System.Backup.S3.BucketName |The S3 bucket name. It corresponds to the "Bucket" in GCS and the "Container" in Azure Blob, respectively.|`null`

|System.Backup.S3.Enable |Data is backed up to various S3-compatible storage services, including AWS S3, S3-compatible services such as Ceph S3, 
and specifically supported services like Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and Azure Blob Storage. 
The specific storage service used for the backup is determined by the `System.Backup.S3.Endpoint` configuration setting. 

If this parameter is set to true, `System.Backup.Local.Enable` cannot be set to true.|`+false+`

|System.Backup.S3.Endpoint 
a| A fully qualified URI, such as https://s3.amazonaws.com/, 
is used to specify the storage serviceâ€™s endpoint for the client.
It is used in the following situations:

* To backup to a private AWS S3, typically set it to "https://s3.amazonaws.com/" or any available URI.
* To backup to an S3-compatible service, set it to its corresponding service URI.
* To backup to Google Cloud Storage (GCS), set it to "https://storage.googleapis.com"
* To backup to Azure Blob, set it to "https://<your storage account name>.blob.core.windows.net"." +

Except for the above specific situations, leave it empty.| `null`

|System.Backup.TimeoutSec |Timeout limit for the backup operation in seconds |`+18000+`

|System.Backup.CompressProcessNumber | Number of concurrent processes for compression during backup. `0` means the number of processes used to compress is equal to the number of CPU cores on each node.

It's recommended to keep the default value `10`.
| `10`

|System.Backup.DecompressProcessNumber | The number of concurrent processes for decompression during the restore.
| `8`

|System.Backup.CompressionLevel |The backup compression level strikes a balance between size and speed. The better compression, the longer it takes.
("BestSpeed", "DefaultCompression", "BestCompression")
| "DefaultCompression"
|===

== Configure backup and restore

Running `gadmin config entry backup` allows you to enter the value for each parameter individually.

Alternatively, you can also use `gadmin config set <parameter>` to change the value of any parameter.

After configuring the parameters, run `gadmin config apply` to apply the new parameter values.

== Configure System.Backup.S3.Endpoint

Typically, there's no need to configure the `System.Backup.S3.Endpoint` parameter on a TigerGraph Server.
This is because the system auto-detects the regional endpoint for AWS S3 backups. 

.Users should configure this parameter *only* for special cases, such as:
* To backup to a private AWS S3, typically set it to "https://s3.amazonaws.com/" or any available URI.
* To backup to an S3-compatible service, set it to its corresponding service URI.
* To backup to Google Cloud Storage (GCS), set it to "https://storage.googleapis.com"
* To backup to Azure Blob, set it to "https://<your storage account name>.blob.core.windows.net"."

Except for the above specific situations, leave it empty.


== Backup to AWS S3
To configure backup files to an AWS S3 Bucket for an on-premise TigerGraph Server cluster, users need to complete the following steps:

. Create an S3 bucket in AWS
. Create an AWS IAM user
. Create an IAM policy that ensures the IAM user has sufficient access to the bucket itself, and contents within the bucket
+
[console,]
----
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>",
                "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
----

. Create an `AccessKeyID` and `SecretAccessKey` for the IAM user
+
Long-lived credentials are what TigerGraph clusters use to authenticate to AWS as the IAM user.
Allowing TigerGraph access to put backup files into the S3 bucket.
Also, to read/copy the files during the restore process.
+
NOTE: TigerGraph does not support short-lived credentials as of TigerGraph 3.9.3.

. Configure each of the following parameters on the linux command line:
+
.Enable storing backup data in S3
[console,]
----
gadmin config set "System.Backup.S3.Enable" "true"
----
+
.Specify bucket name
[console,]
----
gadmin config set "System.Backup.S3.BucketName" "<bucket-name>"
----
+
.Set S3 backup AccessKeyID
[console,]
----
gadmin config set "System.Backup.S3.AWSAccessKeyID" "<access-key-id>"
----
+
.Set S3 backup SecretAccessKey
[console,]
----
gadmin config set "System.Backup.S3.AWSSecretAccessKey" "<secret-access-key>"
----
+
.Apply the new parameter values
[console,]
----
gadmin config apply -y
----

== Backup to Azure Blob

Similar to AWS S3, once the Azure Blob Container is created and configured properly, for more information,see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction[Introduction to Azure Blob Storage],
users only need to complete the configurations by the following steps:

. Enable storing backup data in S3
+
[console,]
----
gadmin config set "System.Backup.S3.Enable" "true"
----
. Specify the backup S3 Endpoint
+
[console,]
----
gadmin config set "System.Backup.S3.Endpoint" "https://<account-name>.blob.core.windows.net"
----
. Specify bucket name
+
[console,]
----
gadmin config set "System.Backup.S3.BucketName" "<container-name>"
----
. Set S3 backup AccessKeyID
+
[console,]
----
gadmin config set "System.Backup.S3.AWSAccessKeyID" "<account-name>"
----

. Set S3 backup SecretAccessKey
+
[console,]
----
gadmin config set "System.Backup.S3.AWSSecretAccessKey" "<account-key>"
----
. Apply the new parameter values
+
[console,]
----
gadmin config apply -y
