= Uninstallation

To uninstall TigerGraph, open the command line of the Linux server and switch to the TigerGraph user, which is created during link:install.adoc[installation]:

[source,bash]
----
$ su - <username>       # Default username is tigergraph
----

Then as the TigerGraph user, run the following Linux command:

[source,bash]
----
$ guninstall
----

If you have the TigerGraph platform installed on a multi-node cluster, when running the `guninstall`  command on a single node in the cluster, you will have the option to uninstall TigerGraph from all of the nodes in the cluster or just a single node.
