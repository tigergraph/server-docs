=== Define filenames
First we define _filenames_, which are local variables referring to data files (or data objects).

[NOTE]
The terms `FILENAME` and `filevar` are used for legacy reasons, but a `filevar` can also be an object in a data object store.

[source,php]
.DEFINE FILENAME syntax
----
DEFINE FILENAME filevar ["=" file_descriptor ];
----

The file descriptor can be specified at compile time or at runtime.
Runtime settings override compile-time settings:

[source,php]
.Specifying file descriptor at runtime
----
RUN LOADING JOB job_name USING filevar=file_descriptor_override
