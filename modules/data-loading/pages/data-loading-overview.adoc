= Data Loading Overview
:description: Overview of available loading methods and supported features.

Once you have xref:gsql-ref:ddl-and-loading:defining-a-graph-schema.adoc[defined a graph schema], you can load data into the graph. This section focuses on how to configure TigerGraph for the different data sources, as well as different data formats and transport schemes.

== Data Sources

You have several options for data sources:

* *Local Files*: Files residing on a TigerGraph server can be loaded without the need to create a GSQL DATA_SOURCE object. This option can have the highest performance.

* *Outside Sources*: Loading data from an outside source, such as cloud storage, requires one additional step to first define a DATA_SOURCE object, which uses the *Kafka Connect* framework. GSQL can then treat it like it treats a local file. You can use this approach for the following data sources:
+
** Cloud storage (Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage)
** Data warehouse query results (Google BigQuery)
** External Kafka cluster
+
See the pages for the specific method that fits your data source.

* *Spark/JDBC*: To load data from other big data platforms, such as Hadoop, the typical method is to use Spark's built-in feature to write a DataFrame to a JDBC target, together with TigerGraph's `POST /ddl` REST endpoint.

== Loading Workflow

TigerGraph uses the same workflow for both local file and Kafka Connect loading:

. *Specify a graph*.
Data is always loading to exactly one graph (though that graph could have global vertices and edges which are shared with other graphs). For example:
+
[source,php]
USE GRAPH ldbc_snb

. If you are using Kafka Connect, *define a `DATA_SOURCE` object*.
See the details on the pages for cloud storage, BigQuery, or an external Kafka cluster.

. *Create a xref:#_loading_jobs[loading job]*.

. *Run your loading job*.

== Loading System Architecture

This diagram shows that supported data sources, which connector to use, and which TigerGraph component manages the data loading.

== Loading Jobs
A loading job tells the database how to construct vertices and edges from data sources.

[source,php]
.CREATE LOADING JOB syntax
----
CREATE LOADING JOB <job_name> FOR GRAPH <graph_name> {
  <DEFINE statements>
  <LOAD statements>
}
----
The opening line does some naming:

* assigns a name to this job: (`<job_name>`)
* associates this job with a graph (`<graph_name>`)

The loading job body has two parts:

. DEFINE statements create variables to refer to data sources.
These can refer to actual files or be placeholder names. The actual data sources can be given when running the loading job.

. LOAD statements specify how to take the data fields from files to construct vertices or edges.

NOTE: Refer to the xref:gsql-ref:ddl-and-loading:creating-a-loading-job.adoc[Creating a Loading Job] documentation for full details

== Set up a data source for a data streaming loading job

GSQL uses a user-provided configuration file to automatically set up a streaming data connection and a loading job for data in these external cloud data hosts:

* Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
* AWS S3
* Azure Blob Storage (ABS)
* Google BigQuery

Go to the xref:data-streaming-connector/index.adoc[] main page for instructions on setting up the loading job.

NOTE: The data streaming will stage temporary data files on the database server's disk.
You should have free disk space of at least 2 times the size of your total (uncompressed) input data.

== Manual connector setup
For data stored in an external Kafka cluster, you need to perform a few more steps to set up data streaming.
Using `gadmin` server commands, you first create a connector to interpret the data source, then define the data source, create the loading job, and run it.

See the xref:data-streaming-connector/kafka.adoc[Kafka cluster streaming] page for more information.

This method relies on the xref:kafka-loader/index.adoc[TigerGraph Kafka Loader].
