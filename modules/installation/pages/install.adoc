:description: Installing Single-machine and Multi-machine systems

This guide describes how to install the TigerGraph platform either as a single node or as a multi-node cluster, interactively or non-interactively.

NOTE: If you signed up for the Enterprise Free license, you also have access to the TigerGraph platform as a Docker image or a virtual machine (VirtualBox) image.   Follow the instructions in xref:../../../cloud/getting-started.adoc[Getting started] to start up TigerGraph in a Docker container or with VirtualBox.

== Preparation

Before you can install the TigerGraph system, you need the following:

* One or more machines that meet the minimum xref:../hw-and-sw-requirements.adoc[_Hardware and Software Requirements_].
* A sudo user with the same username and login credential on every machine.
 ** If sudo privilege is not available, please contact TigerGraph support for workarounds.
* A license key provided by TigerGraph (not applicable to Enterprise Free)
* A TigerGraph system package
 ** If you do not yet have a TigerGraph system package, you can request one at the following address: https://www.tigergraph.com/get-tigergraph/
* If you are installing a cluster, ensure that every machine has the same SSH port and the port stays open during installation

== *Installation*

TigerGraph's installation script support both single-node and cluster installation, and the user can choose to install either interactively and non-interactively.

=== Interactive installation

The following describes the procedure to install TigerGraph on Linux interactively. The filename of your package may vary, depending on the product edition and version. For the examples here, we use the filename `tigergraph-<version>.tar.gz`, which should be replaced by the actual filename of your package.

==== *Step 1*: Extract the package

Extract the package by running the following command. A folder named `tigergraph-<version>-offline` __**__will be created.


[tabs]
====
Tab A::
+
--
[,bash]
----
$ tar -xzf tigergraph-<version>.tar.gz
----
--
Tab B::
+
--
[,bash]
----
$ gadmin status
----
--
====

==== *Step 2*:  Run installation script

Navigate to the `tigergraph-<version>-offline` folder and run script `install.sh`  with the following commands:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Example: Default installation for +++<version>+++= 3.1.0" %}+++</version>+++

[,bash]
----
$ cd tigergraph-<version>-offline

# to install enterprise license
$ sudo ./install.sh

# For non-interactive installations, please see the non-interactive mode section.
----

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The installer will ask for the following information, for which you may choose to hit Enter to skip and use the system default or enter a new value:

* Your agreement to the License Terms and Conditions
* Your license key (not applicable for Enterprise Free)
* Username for the Linux user who will own and manage the TigerGraph platform
 ** The installer creates a Linux user who is the only authorized user that can run `gadmin` commands to manage the TigerGraph Platform, and for whom this username is for
* Password for the Linux user who will own and manage the TigerGraph platform
* Path to where the installation folder will be
* Path to where the data folder will be
* Path to where the log folder will be
* Path to where the temp folder will be
* The SSH port for your machine

To see what the default settings are, read the link:install.md#installation-options[Installation options] section below.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Since license keys are long -- over 100 characters long. If you copy-and-paste the license key, be careful not to accidentally include an end-of-line character.
{% endhint %}

==== *Step 3*: Configure cluster settings

TigerGraph cluster configuration enables the graph database to be partitioned and distributed across multiple server nodes in a local network. After you have answered the questions described in the previous step, the installation script will ask for the following to complete cluster configuration:

* The number of nodes in your cluster. Each node  will be given an alias following the input (`m1`, `m2`, `m3`, etc.)
 ** If this is a single-node installation, enter `1`
* The IP address of each node
* Username and credentials information of the sudo user
 ** Every machine in the cluster must have a sudo user with the same username and password or SSH key.
* Permission to set NPT time synchronization
* Permission to set firewall rules among the cluster nodes

{% hint style="info" %}
In TigerGraph 3.x, the installation machine can be within or outside the cluster. If outside the cluster, the installation machine still needs to be a Linux machine.
{% endhint %}

After all the questions are answered, the script will proceed to installation. A screenshot of the interactive installation is shown below:

image::../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2876%29.png[]

==== *Step 4*: Verify installation

After installation is complete, you can switch to the Linux user who owns the platform (created in link:install.md#step-2-run-installation-script[Step 2]) with the following command :

[,bash]
----
$ su <username>  # default username: tigergraph
----

At the prompt, enter the password that was set in Step 2.

After switching to the correct user, you now have access to xref:../system-management/management-with-gadmin.adoc[`gadmin` commands]. Confirm successful installation by running `gadmin status`. If the system is installed correctly and the license is activated, the command should report that all services are up and ready. Since there is no graph data loaded yet, GSE __**__and GPE will show `"Warmup"`.

=== Non-interactive installation

The following describes the procedure to install TigerGraph on Linux non-interactively.

==== *Step 1*: Extract the package

Extract the package by running the following command. A folder named `tigergraph-<version>-offline` __**__will be created.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Example: extract for +++<version>+++= x.y.z" %}+++</version>+++

[,bash]
----
$ tar -xzf tigergraph-<version>.tar.gz
----

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

==== Step 2: Configure installation settings

Navigate to the `tigergraph-<version>-offline` folder. Inside the folder, there is a file named `install_conf.json`. For non-interactive mode installation, the user must review and modify all the settings in the file _**_`install_conf.json` before running the installer.

Below is an example of the `install_conf.json` file:

Here is a description of all the fields in the config file:

* `"BasicConfig"`
 ** `"TigerGraph"` : Information about the Linux user that will be created by the installer who owns and manages the TigerGraph platform.
  *** `"Username"`: Username of the Linux user.
  *** `"Password"`: Password of the Linux user.
  *** `"SSHPort"`: Port number used to establish SSH connections.
  *** `"PrivateKeyFile"` (optional):  Absolute path to a valid private key file. If left empty, TigerGraph will generate one named `tigergraph.rsa` automatically.
  *** `"PublicKeyFile"`(optional): Absolute path to a valid public key file. If left empty, TigerGraph will generate one named `tigergraph.pub` automatically.
 ** `"RootDir"`
  *** `"AppRoot"`: Absolute path to where application folder will be.
  *** ``"DataRoot``": Absolute path to where the data folder will be.
  *** `"LogRoot"`: Absolute path to where the log folder will be.
  *** `"TempRoot"`: Absolute path to where the temp folder will be.
 ** `"License"`: Your TigerGraph license string.
 ** `"Node List"`:  A JSON array of the nodes in the cluster. Each machine in the cluster is defined as a key-value pair, where the key is a machine alias (m1, m2, m3, etc) and the value is the IP address of the node.
* `"AdvancedConfig"`
 ** `"ClusterConfig"`: Cluster configurations
  *** `"LoginConfig"`: Login configurations
   **** `"SudoUser"`: Username of the sudo user who will be used to execute the installation on all nodes.
   **** `"Method"`: Authentication method for SSH. Enter `"P"` to use password authentication and `"K"` to use key-based authentication.
   **** `"P"`: Password of the sudo user.
   **** `"K"`: Absolute path to the SSH key to be used to authenticate the sudo user.
  *** `"ReplicationFactor"`: link:../../../tigergraph-platform-overview/continuous-availability-overview.md#continuous-availability-definitions[Replication factor] of the cluster.
   **** If you would like to enable the High Availability (HA) feature, please make sure you have at least 3 nodes in the cluster and set the replication factor to be greater than 1. For example, if your cluster has 6 nodes, you could set the replication factor to be 2 or 3. If you set the replication factor to be 2, then the partitioning factor will be  6 / 2 = 3.  Therefore, 3 nodes will be used for one copy of the data, and the other 3 nodes will be used as a replica copy of the data.
   **** Ensure that the total number of nodes can be fully divided by the replication factor.  Otherwise, some nodes may not be utilized as parts of the HA cluster.

==== Step 3: Run install script with `-n` option

Start the non-interactive installation process by running the `install.sh` script with the `-n` option:

[,bash]
----
$ sudo ./install.sh -n
----

=== Installation options

The following default settings will be applied if no parameters are specified:

* The installer will create a Linux user with username `tigergraph` and with password `tigergraph`. This user will be the only user authorized to run `gadmin` commands to manage the TigerGraph platform and services.
 ** If there is already a user named `tigergraph`, this user will be designated as the platform owner and no other user will be created.
* The default root directory for the installation would be `/home/tigergraph/tigergraph` ****with the App/Data/Log/Temp files within it : App Path : `/home/tigergraph/tigergraph/app` ****Data Path :``/home/tigergraph/tigergraph/data`` ****Log Path :``/home/tigergraph/tigergraph/log`` ****Temp Path :``/home/tigergraph/tigergraph/tmp``
* The root directory for the installation (referred to as `<tigerGraph_root_dir>`) is a folder called `tigergraph` __**__located in the tigergraph user's home directory, i.e., `/home/tigergraph/tigergraph`.

The installation can be customized by running command-line options with the `install.sh` script:

==== Command-line options

[,bash]
----
# Command-line options for install.sh
Usage:
./install.sh [-n] [-u <user>] [-p <password>] [-r <tigergraph_root_dir>] [-l <license_key>] [-F] [-N]
./install.sh -h
Options:
  -h  --  Show help information
  -u  --  Username of Linux user to create [default: tigergraph]
  -p  --  Password of Linux user to create [default: tigergraph]
  -l  --  TigerGraph license key
  -n  --  Non-interactive option: suppress prompts, and install
          using default config
  -F  --  Set iptables (firewall) rules to open TCP ports among cluster nodes
  -N  --  Set NTP system time synchronization among cluster nodes

[NOTE    ]: Using option '-n' will non-interactively install the platform
            on single node or cluster with all configurations from
            config file "install_config.json". In this case, the config
            file should be modified before installation.

[WARNING ]: Installer will fail if any option (except -F and -N)
            is provided with option '-n' at the same time.
