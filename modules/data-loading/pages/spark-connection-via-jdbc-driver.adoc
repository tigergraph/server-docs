= Spark Connection Via JDBC Driver

Apache Spark is a popular big data distributed processing system which is frequently used in data management ETL process and Machine Learning applications.

Using the open-source type 4 JDBC Driver for TigerGraph,  you can read and write data between Spark and TigerGraph. This is a two-way data connection.

.Apache Spark, containing streaming and static data sources, uses the JDBC driver to communicate back and forth with TigerGraph in order to perform graph analytics.

The TigerGraph services shown are Graph Insights and applications, graph business intelligence, and graph visualization, all under the theme of Real-Time Graph Analytics."]

The Github Link to the JDBC Driver is https://github.com/tigergraph/ecosys/tree/master/tools/etl/tg-jdbc-driver +

The README file there provides more details.

[WARNING]
====
TigerGraph JDBC connector is streaming in data via REST endpoints.
No data throttle mechanism is in place yet.
When the incoming concurrent JDBC connection number exceeds the configured hardware capacity limit, the overload may cause the system to stop responding.

If you use spark job to connect TigerGraph via JDBC, we recommend your concurrent spark loading jobs be capped at 10 with the following per job configuration.
This limits the concurrent JDBC connections to 40.

== Load from a Data Lake via Spark

=== 1) Write a Spark `DataFrameWriter`

Write a Spark DataFrameWriter function that will write data to CSV files, following the example below.

NOTE: You need to choose names for a GSQL loading job and its data files that you will be using in Step 2.



.Example: `DataFrameWriter` as  "df"
[source, gsql]
df.write.mode("overwrite").format("jdbc").options(
    Map(
        "driver" -> "com.tigergraph.jdbc.Driver",
        "url" -> "jdbc:tg:http://host:port",
        "username" -> "tigergraph",
        "password" -> "tigergraph",
        "token" -> "token",
        "graph" -> "Social", // graph name
        "dbtable" -> "job load_Social", // loading job name, "job" is required
        "filename" -> "file1", // filename defined in the loading job
        "sep" -> ",", // separator between columns
        "eol" -> "\n", // end of line
        "batchsize" -> "10000"))
    .save()

The `sep` and `eol` will be used to convert the `DataFrame` to delimited data and that will be sent to the filename defined by the loading job.

.Example: DataFrame
[source, gsql]
> DataFrame
+-----+---+------+
|  _c0|_c1|   _c2|
+-----+---+------+
|  Tom| 23|  male|
|Jerry| 45|  male|
|Jenny| 33|female|
|Lizzy| 19|female|
+-----+---+------+

.Example: Delimited Data
[source, gsql]
Tom,23,male
Jerry,45,male
Jenny,33,female
Lizzy,19,female

=== 2) Create a Loading Job

Write a GSQL loading job, using the job and file names that you used in step 1, to map data from the CSV file(s) to TigerGraph vertices and edges.

.Example:
[source, gsql]
CREATE LOADING JOB load_Social FOR GRAPH Social {
    DEFINE FILENAME file1;
    DEFINE FILENAME file2;
    LOAD file1 TO VERTEX Person VALUES ($0, $1, $2);
    LOAD file2 TO EDGE Friendship VALUES ($0, $1);
}

The loading job above, `load_Social` loads the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd columns of source file, `file1`, to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd attributes of the vertex `Person`.

//Alternatively, loading jobs can be run as post requests.
//.Example: Post Request to TigerGraph
//[source, gsql]
//http://host:port/restpp/ddl/Social?tag=load_Social&filename=file1
//--data <delimited_data>

See the pages xref:gsql-ref:ddl-and-loading:creating-a-loading-job.adoc[], xref:gsql-ref:ddl-and-loading:running-a-loading-job.adoc[] and xref:tigergraph-server:API:built-in-endpoints.adoc#_loading_jobs[Loading Jobs as a REST Endpoint] for more information about loading jobs in TigerGraph.

== Advanced Usages with Spark

=== Enable SSL with Spark
Add the following options to your scala script:

[source, gsql]
    "trustStore" -> "trust.jks",
    "trustStorePassword" -> "password",
    "trustStoreType" -> "JKS",

And run it with `--files` option like this:

[source, gsql]
/path/to/spark/bin/spark-shell --jars /path/to/tigergraph-jdbc-driver-${VERSION}.jar --files /path/to/trust.jks -i test.scala

The `--files` should be provided the JKS file path, while the `"trustStore" -> "trust.jks"` should be the JKS filename only.

=== Load Statistics

[WARNING]
====
TigerGraph JDBC connector is streaming in data via REST endpoints.
No data throttle mechanism is in place yet.
When the incoming concurrent JDBC connection number exceeds the configured hardware capacity limit, the overload may cause the system to stop responding.
If you use a Spark job to connect TigerGraph via JDBC, we recommend your concurrent Spark loading jobs be capped at 10 with the following per job configuration.
This limits the concurrent JDBC connections to 40.
====

To load data from files:

.Example: 2 executors per job where each executor takes 2 cores.
[source, gsql]
/path/to/spark/bin/spark-shell --jars /path/to/tigergraph-jdbc-driver-${VERSION}.jar -—num-executors 2 —-executor-cores 2 -i test.scala

.Example: Invoke loading job
[source, gsql]
val df = sc.textFile("/path/to/your_file", 100).toDF()
df.write.mode("append").format("jdbc").options(
    Map(
        "driver" -> "com.tigergraph.jdbc.Driver",
        "url" -> "jdbc:tg:http://127.0.0.1:14240",
        "username" -> "tigergraph",
        "password" -> "tigergraph",
        "graph" -> "ldbc_snb",
        "dbtable" -> "job load_ldbc_snb", // loading job name
        "filename" -> "v_comment_file", // filename defined in the loading job
        "sep" -> "|", // separator between columns
        "eol" -> "\n", // End Of Line
        "batchsize" -> "10000",
        "debug" -> "0",
        "logFilePattern" -> "/tmp/jdbc.log")).save()

*If your TG version is 3.9.0 or higher, please use the following new features:*

* `jobid`: Since the Spark loading is sending data in multiple batches, it's hard to collect the loading stats of all the batches.
The `jobid` is a new connection property that helps aggregate the stats of each batch loading, so the overall loading stats can be easily acquired.

* `max_num_error`: The threshold of the error objects count within the `jobid`.
The loading job will be aborted when reaching the limit. `jobid` is required.

* `max_percent_error`: Is the threshold of the error objects percentage within the `jobid`.
The loading job will be aborted when reaching the limit.
`jobid` is required.

NOTE: For a more detailed example, please refer to the https://github.com/tigergraph/ecosys/blob/master/tools/etl/tg-jdbc-driver/tg-jdbc-examples/src/main/java/com/tigergraph/jdbc/examples/SparkLoadingJob.scala#L55-L57[GitHub link].

*For the `"batchsize"` option:*

* *If it is set too small*, lots of time will be spent on setting up connections.
* *If it is too large*, the http payload may exceed limit (the default TigerGraph Rest++ maximum payload size is 128MB). Furthermore, a large `"batchsize"` may result in high jitter performance.

To bypass the disk IO limitation, it is better to put the raw data file on a different disk other than the one used by TigerGraph.

== Specific Usages for a Spark DataFrame in TigerGraph

=== Bulk Load
To read the full delta table as a Spark DataFrame and a bulk load to TigerGraph:

[source, gsql]
val df = spark.read.format("delta").load("/tmp/delta-table")
df.write.mode("overwrite").format("jdbc").options(
    Map(
        "driver" -> "com.tigergraph.jdbc.Driver",
        "url" -> "jdbc:tg:http://host:port",
        ...))
    .save()

=== Capture Changes in Batch Queries

. Enable the change data feed option on the Delta table:
+
[source, gsql]
ALTER TABLE myDeltaTable SET TBLPROPERTIES (delta.enableChangeDataFeed = true)

. Capture the changes into a DataFrame:
+
.Example 1: Version is type `int` or `long`:
[source, gsql]
val df = spark.read.format("delta")
    .option("readChangeFeed", "true")
    .option("startingVersion", 0)
    .option("endingVersion", 10)
    .table("myDeltaTable")
+
.Example 2: Timestamps as formatted as `timestamp`:
[source, gsql]
val df = spark.read.format("delta")
    .option("readChangeFeed", "true")
    .option("startingTimestamp", "2021-04-21 05:45:46")
    .option("endingTimestamp", "2021-05-21 12:00:00")
    .table("myDeltaTable")
+
.Example 3: Providing only the starting Version/timestamp:
[source, gsql]
val df = spark.read.format("delta")
    .option("readChangeFeed", "true")
    .option("startingVersion", 0)
    .table("myDeltaTable")
+
.Example 4: Path to table:
[source, gsql]
val df = spark.read.format("delta")
    .option("readChangeFeed", "true")
    .option("startingTimestamp", "2021-04-21 05:45:46")
    .load("pathToMyDeltaTable")

. Filter the changes:
+
The DataFrame containing the changes of the Delta table has https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta/delta-change-data-feed.html#what-is-the-schema-for-the-change-data-feed[3 additional columns]:
+
[cols="3"]
|===
|Column name |Type | Values
| `_change_type` | String | insert, update_preimage , update_postimage, delete
| `_commit_version` | Long | The Delta log or table version containing the change.
| `_commit_timestamp` | Timestamp | The timestamp associated when the commit was created.
|===
+
A TigerGraph GSQL loading job only supports an insertion or an updating type, so filtering of the result is needed:
+
[source, gsql]
df.filter($"_change_type" === "insert" || $"_change_type" === update_postimage)

. Select original data columns:
+
[source, gsql]
df.select("_c0", "_c1", "_c2")

. Write the DataFrame to TigerGraph:
+
[source, gsql]
df.write.mode("overwrite").format("jdbc").options(
    Map(
        "driver" -> "com.tigergraph.jdbc.Driver",
        "url" -> "jdbc:tg:http://host:port",
        ...))
    .save()

=== Full Example

Below is a full example of the previous steps with more options.

.Capture changes + filter the insertion and updating:
[source, gsql]
val df = spark.read.format("delta")
    .option("readChangeFeed", "true")
    .option("startingVersion", 0)
    .option("endingVersion", 10)
    .table("myDeltaTable")
    .filter($"_change_type" === "insert" || $"_change_type" === update_postimage)

.Now write the changes from the DataFrame to TigerGraph
[source, gsql]
df.write.mode("overwrite").format("jdbc").options(
    Map(
        "driver" -> "com.tigergraph.jdbc.Driver",
        "url" -> "jdbc:tg:http://host:port",
        "username" -> "tigergraph",
        "password" -> "tigergraph",
        "token" -> "token",
        "graph" -> "Social", // graph name
        "dbtable" -> "job load_Social", // loading job name, "job" is required
        "filename" -> "file1", // filename defined in the loading job
        "sep" -> ",", // separator between columns
        "eol" -> "\n", // end of line
        "batchsize" -> "10000"))
    .save()
