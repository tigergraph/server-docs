# Spark Connection Via JDBC Driver

Apache Spark is a popular big data distributed processing system which is frequently used in data management ETL process and Machine Learning applications.

Using the open-source type 4 JDBC Driver for TigerGraph,  you can read and write data between Spark and TigerGraph. This is a two-way data connection.

The Github Link to the JDBC Driver is [https://github.com/tigergraph/ecosys/tree/master/tools/etl/tg-jdbc-driver](https://github.com/tigergraph/ecosys/tree/master/tools/etl/tg-jdbc-driver)  
The README file there provides more details.

Note that the TigerGraph JDBC Driver has more use cases than just as a Spark Connection. You can use TigerGraph's JDBC Driver for your Java and Python applications. This is an open source project.
